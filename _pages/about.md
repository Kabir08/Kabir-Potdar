Hi there! I’m Kabir, a Technology aficionado 🔧📊 with a passion for solving complex problems and building innovative solutions 🚀. I hopped on the Jourey on the Journey of Computer Science, with Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering and it's programme of Electronics and Telecommunications being my First Official guide. I discovered emmense possiblities of computer science. Built strong Mathematics base with subjects Engineering Mathematics I, II, III and Computer Science core subjects of Programming, Data Structures and OOPs. On that base I ventured into fields of Cloud Computing, Deep Learning, Database Management, Mobile Computing, VLSI Design. Yeah... I studied lenghts and bredths 😪. 
I am quite absorvant to many quotes. One of that Includes "Success is when preparation meets opportunity." – Seneca
Inspired by this perspective, I approach every challenge with preparation, strategy, and a drive to learn 🧠💡. This mindset has shaped my academic and professional endeavors, from building IoT-based cold storage systems 🛠️🌡️ to exploring cutting-edge AI models like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers 🤖📚 during my internship as a Machine Learning Engineer.
I’m not all about code, though! When I’m not deep in my projects, you’ll find me:

💪 Hitting the gym
🌍 Going on adventures
👫 Spending quality time with friends

Life’s all about balance, and I try to make the most of every moment while staying focused on my goals! 🎯

About Me 👋
Hi there! I’m Kabir, a tech enthusiast 🔧📊 with a passion for solving complex problems and building innovative solutions 🚀. My journey into the world of computer science began during my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Telecommunication, where I discovered the immense possibilities that programming and machine learning offer.

Inspired by Abraham Lincoln’s words, “Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe,” I approach every challenge with preparation, strategy, and a drive to learn 🧠💡. This mindset has shaped my academic and professional endeavors, from building IoT-based cold storage systems 🛠️🌡️ to exploring cutting-edge AI models like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers 🤖📚 during my internship as a Machine Learning Engineer.

I’m not all about code, though! When I’m not deep in my projects, you’ll find me:

💪 Hitting the gym
🌍 Going on adventures
👫 Spending quality time with friends
Life’s all about balance, and I try to make the most of every moment while staying laser-focused on my goals! 🎯

My Skills 💻
I’ve had the opportunity to work with some amazing technologies and develop a versatile skill set:

Programming Languages: Python 🐍, C++ ➕➕, JavaScript 🖥️
Data Analysis & Machine Learning: TensorFlow 🔍🤖, scikit-learn, Pandas
Web Development: React.js ⚛️, Node.js 🌐, SQL
Tools & Platforms: Kubernetes, TradingView (Pine Script 📈), Raspberry Pi 🍓
These skills were honed through hands-on projects, internships, and tackling competitive challenges that pushed me to think creatively and adapt quickly.

What Drives Me 💡
======
I am quite passionate about Computer Science and it's various branches, I always try to learn more about it's different things and new technologies. It's all byproduct of my curiosity. Coupled that with dedication, I have produced some good results that I am proud of ranking in top 29 percentile of users on LeetCode 🏆, competing globally on Meta Hacker cup 🔑. I learned that every setback is a opportunity.
I am passionate about more technologies of Computer Science going to the deeps of Machine Learning, Software, Algorithems and Computer Vision. I am excited to grow further and collaborate with like-minded innovators and engineers who share the same vision.

Projects I’m Proud Of 🔥
------

Here are a few highlights from my journey:

IoT-Based Smart Cold Storage 🌡️

Developed an intelligent inventory tracking system for dairy products using Raspberry Pi and electronic sensors.
Led the software component and presented the project using captivating storytelling techniques.
Multi-Disease-ML [PCCOE, Pune] (Jan 2023 – Feb 2023)

Team Size: 2 | Role: Team Lead
Developed a Multi-Disease prediction website leveraging Python, Jupyter Notebook, FastAPI, and Streamlit.
Enabled users to input parameter values and receive predictions on whether they might have specific diseases.
TouchGrass 🌱

Built a platform connecting like-minded individuals through events and communities, fostering collaboration and friendships.
Each project has been a stepping stone, teaching me the importance of teamwork, creativity, and user-first thinking 🎨.

Let’s Connect! 🤝
------
I’m always excited to connect with people who share a passion for technology and innovation! Whether you’d like to brainstorm ideas 🧠, collaborate on a project 🤝, or simply chat about tech, feel free to reach out.

<!-- **Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
